        <p>We've been busy at work on a couple of projects. More on that soon.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, we are taking the opportunity to publish some of the libraries and tools that we've been using in our apps.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="page-section">
        <h2>Libraries</h2>
        <p>Mostly bower packages, focused on AngularJS v1.x.</p> 
        <p>Most of the libraries have extensive coverage, documentation and demos.</p> 
    </section>

    <section class="page-section">
        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <p>These are mostly Grunt tools and boilerplates that support the build process of the AngularJS libraries.</p>
